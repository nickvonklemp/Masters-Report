- Lagrange dynmaics for multibody system could have produced a more concise model etc \ldots\\
- Particule multibody dynamics with internactions could provide a more verbose simulation environment rather than the very newtonian simulation loop constructed\\
- Implicit equation dynamics in simulation may improve optimization loops in PSO algorithm
- Firmware changes to ESC drastically improved transfer function time constant, made assumption that servos would improve actuator response times redundant.
-Difficulty with non-linear multibody in Sec:\ref{sec:dynamics.nonlinearities} causes stiffness in control optimization. Same troubles with time varying inertias caused Osprey inspiration issues too...
