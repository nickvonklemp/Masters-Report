\section{A Brief Background to the Study}
\label{sec:ch1.study}
%====================================================
Currently the most popular topic for control and automation research is that of quadrotor UAVs, specifically into the non-linear control thereof. The avenues for potential applications of both fixed wing and VTOL UAVs is expansive and the quadrotor configuration provides a mechanically simple and low cost platform. Considering that commercial drone usage is such an emerging sector; especially in Southern Africa following the revision of aviation laws which have legalized the use of UAVs for commercial application. 
\par
Large scale quadrotor helicopters are a popular intermediate choice for aerial cinematography.  Whilst still expensive, the cost of a commercial drone like the SteadiDrone Maverik \cite{steadidrone} is far less than the cost of chartering a helicopter to achieve the same photographic scenes. Another interesting application for UAVs is in the agricultural sector, introducing crop dusting drones instead of the traditional bi-planes which perform the same job. One difficulty which hinders the progress of the commercial drone sector is that of inertia, specifically when scaling up any vehicle, its performance is adversely affected, due to the increased mass inertial effect.
